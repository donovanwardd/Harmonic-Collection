    <h3>Almost entirely an individual struggle, estrangement lingers after sharing a presence.</h3>

    <h4>Entry #1: Seperation</h4>
    <p> Awakening in familiarity, the scene’s masquerade tells of secrets <br> 
      Inviting with a beckoning finger, comfort does not open her arms <br>
      She walks forwards, looking back occasionally for the hopeful <br>
      Her shaul sweeping the ground beneath her strides <br>
      The distance insights liberation, and liberation, heartache <br>
      Ideation of the self <br>
      Slips with each step taken <br>
      A wish of intimacy <br>
      A dream of familiarity </p>
