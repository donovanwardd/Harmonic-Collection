    <h3> <em>Winter on the Shorefront</em></h3>
    <article>
      <h4 id="first">Paragraph 1</h4>
      <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe footprints I set in the sand on the coast,</p>
      <p>&nbsp&nbspAre covered up gently by the delicate snowfall.</p>
      <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspMy childhood house,</p>
       <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspSitting on its perch just shy of the cliffside,</p>
        <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspRevels in the glory of the first light of dawn.</p>
        <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspA trial,</p>
        <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspSet by my boots,</p>
        <p> Leads to the oak front door.</p>
        <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe secret route, shared only between me and the home,</p>
        <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspSlowly becomes lost within surrounding tall grass.</p>
        <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspAs the wheels lurch forward, the wheel of fate turns.</p>
        <p> The window, steamed by my breath, covers my view of the house.</p>
        <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspBehind the fog, destiny smiles on the house, </p>
        <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspSunshine enveloping its walls, pouring into the emptied rooms.</p>
        <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspMy secrets, my home, my childhood.</p>
        <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspRemain intact,</p>
        <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspIn the walls of my mind.</p>
