        <p class="large"><b><em>Barbed Wire</em></b></p>
        
       <p>Underneath the dense veils of pollen, in between the age-old redwoods,
        <p>Underoath, sworn to his family, a boy crosses the border to the outside.
        <p> Marked by a barb-wire fence that stood about three stumps tall,
        <p> The outside did not look too different to the boy.
        <p> Same trees, same grass, same stream that ran right through one and into the other.
        <p> Teacher had told him that the inside was perfect.
        <p> Teacher had told him that he shouldn't go outside, not that he couldn't.
        <p> Plus, it's not like it was hard to get through the fence.
        <br><br><br>
        <p> The grass, inching its way up his body with every step he took, 
        <p>Began to show more and more resistance to his drive.
        <p>The blades sinking deeper and deeper into his skin,
        <p>The sun beating down, the swishing slurring,
        <p>Blinking, fading, the corners of his eyes blur.
        <p>The boy falters, brought to his knees under the weight of the world.
        <br><br><br>
        <p>A soft, rhythmic jolting is the call of awakening.
        <p>The boy, facing the board shoulders of Teacher, lifts his eyes towards the barbed wire fence.
        <p>Teacher did not speak.
        <p>The boy let out a sigh.
        <p>His eyes returned down to his Teacher,
        <p> The boy tucks his head deep into his Teacherâ€™s back.
